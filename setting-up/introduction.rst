Setting up for DataJoint
------------------------
**Author**: Edgar Y. Walker

**Updated**: 2017-06-05

In this tutorial, we will cover how to setup a DataJoint Python or MATLAB development environment suitable
for following the other tutorials and to explore DataJoint in general. A functional DataJoint development 
setup consists of two parts - a database server for hosting data pipelines and a Python or MATLAB environment
with DataJoint library installed. Natually, our objectives for this tutorial is as follows:

- Explore options on :doc:`how to get connected to a database server <get-database>`
- Installing DataJoint library for :doc:`Python <datajoint-python>` or :doc:`MATLAB <datajoint-matlab>`

System requirements
===================
.. Note:: 
    To complete this tutorial as well as others, you would need a computer with an Internet connection running MacOS, Windows or Linux operating system with either Python 3 or MATLAB already installed, depending on your language preference. DataJoint for Python requires Python 3.4 or above with `pip` already configured (for help on setting up a Python development environment, you can find great resources online including [this](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/)). DataJoint for MATLAB requires MATLAB 2015b or later version to function properly. We will be installing and setting up a database server to run on your machine, so at least 500 MB of disk space is needed.
