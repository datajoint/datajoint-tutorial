What's next?
------------
Now that we have some idea of what data should go into our data pipeline, it's time for us to start building
the pipeline! Data pipeline design and building is a fluid process that is best done through frequent creation,
testing, and revision. Furthermore, data pipeline is typically built **incrementally**, adding new components
into the pipeline as you acquire new types of data and/or perform new analysis. DataJoint was designed from
ground up to support such data pipeline building process! In the next section, we will get starting building
the data pipeline by defining our very first table in the pipeline. The rest of this tutorial is split based
on the DataJoint library language:
